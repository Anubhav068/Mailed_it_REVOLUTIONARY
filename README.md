This is an app which helps us to sync with the gmail or any mailing app on our phone. 
At first the login page will open where the user have to enter Username as "user" and Password as "password". 
Then a new window wil open containg To, Subject, Message and a SEND button.
Then on clicking the SEND button it will be synced with gmail or any other mailing app and then we can send the mail to the recipient.
